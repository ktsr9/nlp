Project Name: Chunking in Telugu using CRF/active learning

How to Run our project: 
* There is a Code folder which contains both test data and train data named as test and train. 
* test contains 23,000 sentences and train data contains 7,000 sentences.
* there is a seperate python script for test data and train data.
* So to change the given data into our required format just run the scirpt train.py for train data with the command "python train.py train traindata_output". This converts the train data into our our format and outputs into the file traindata_output. Similarly we can run for test data too.
